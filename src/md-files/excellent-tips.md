### Maintaining an Excellent Credit Score

1. Keep Your Credit Card Balances Low
    The higher your credit card balance in relation to your credit limit, the worse your credit score will be. Your combined credit card balances should be within 30 percent of your combined credit limits to maintain a good credit score. That’s $300 on credit cards with combined limits of $1,000.

    Charging more than 30 percent of your credit limit is risky even if you plan to pay off the balance when your billing statement arrives. Card issuers typically report the balance when your statement closes, so that's the number that will be reflected on your credit report. It's a good idea to keep tabs on your accounts online and pay enough to reduce your balances to less than 30 percent just before the billing month closes.

2. Don't Close Old Credit Cards

    When you close a credit card, your credit card issuer no longer sends updates to the three credit bureaus—Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion—and the credit scoring formula places less weight on inactive accounts. After 10 years or so, the credit bureau will remove that closed account's history from your credit report, and losing that credit history will shorten your average credit age and cause your credit score to drop.

    Closing a credit card also reduces your available credit. For example, if you have three cards with a combined credit limit of $10,000 and you close one with a $3,000 limit, your combined credit limit will be reduced to $7,000. Since your goal is to keep your credit card balances at less than 30 percent of your available credit, closing that card reduces your threshold by $900

3. Limit Your Applications for New Credit
    
    Too many credit inquiries—whether they be for a credit card or a loan—also can have a negative impact on your score, so make sure you're only applying for credit when it really is necessary. Opening a new credit account also lowers your average credit age

4. Watch Your Credit Report
    Just because you do everything right with your credit doesn’t mean everyone else will. Errors could end up on your credit report leading to a drop in your credit score.

    Identity theft and credit card fraud also can lead to inaccurate information on your credit report.
