1. Pay down your existing debt. 

    Paying down existing debt can help your credit score in the short term because it lowers your overall credit utilization ratio, which is calculated by dividing the amount of revolving credit you are currently using by the total of your available revolving credit limits. A low credit utilization ratio shows lenders you're using less of your available credit. Credit utilization accounts for 30% of your FICO® Score, and lowering it may quickly help to increase your credit scores.

2. Make all your payments on time. 

    Payment history is the most important aspect of your FICO® Score: Even one missed or late payment can have a negative impact on your score. Make sure to pay any outstanding bills and continue to pay them on time to avoid seriously hurting your credit score.

3. Check credit reports for inaccuracies.
 
    Mistakes happen, and having inaccuracies on your credit report could cause your score to drop. Make sure to regularly check your credit reports for inaccurate information. If you find anything in your file that shouldn't be there, contact the appropriate credit bureau or lender to file a dispute as soon as possible.
