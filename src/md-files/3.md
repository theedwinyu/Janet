## Goals should be SMART:
- Specific
* Measurable
* Action-oriented
* Realistic
* Time-based



**Time value of money**: increases in an amount of money as a result of interest earned

Interest calculations (3 amounts are required to calculate the time value of money):

1. Principal (amount of savings)
2. Interest rate (annual)
3. Time period

Interest = savings * annual interest rate * time period

*Compounding* is the most important concept to takeaway from interest and most important for your financial health

For example: 
$515 × 6% × 6 months/12 months = $515 × .06 × ½ year = $15.45 

In **six months**, a **$515** deposit (principal) will earn **$15.45** interest. 

Therefore, you will have a total of $515.45 at the end of the 2nd six months. So **$500** over a year where 6% interest is paid semi-annually will generate **$30.45** in interest.


Every financial decision involves giving up something to obtain something you consider more desirable
Personal resources, like financial resources, require careful management. – Ex. health, abilities, knowledge
